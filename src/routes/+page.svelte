	<h1>Sonofield Ear Trainer</h1>
	<p>
		Sonofield Ear Trainer (SET) is a revolutionary app designed to help you <u
			>intuitively play the melodies you hear and imagine.</u
		>
		Instead of relying on traditional methods, The Sonofield Method focuses on helping you feel the unique
		character of each note within a key. By using sustained drones to create a tonal foundation, youâ€™ll
		learn to recognize scale degrees based on their <u>feeling</u>, not just how they sound.
	</p>

	<p>The app offers a variety of ways to do ear training:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Degrees Mode - Identify individual notes against the drone by feeling. The heart of SET.
		</li>
		<li>Melody Mode - Identify short melodic phrases, preparing you for real music.</li>
		<li>Voice Mode - Sing the requested scale degree into your microphone.</li>
		<li>Pocket Mode - Hands-free training for when you're on the go.</li>
		<li>Free Play - An interactive instrument for exploration.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Why is Sonofield Ear Trainer the best ear training app?</h2>
	<p>
		With its intuitive, color-coded interface, thoughtfully designed progression path, and multiple
		difficulty levels, SET adapts to your skill level while keeping practice engaging. Whether
		you're a beginner or an experienced musician, SET is your guide to unlocking true musical
		fluency through intuitive, feeling-based ear training.
